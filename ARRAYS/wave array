Given an array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array and return it,
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....

nlogn solution:
this is lexographically smallest

vector<int> Solution::wave(vector<int> &A) {
    sort(A.begin(),A.end());
    for(int i=0;i<A.size()-1;i+=2){
        swap(A[i],A[i+1]);
    }
    return A;
}

O(n) solution but it might not be lexographically smallest

This can be done in O(n) time by doing a single traversal of given array. The idea is based on the fact that if we make sure that all even positioned (at index 0, 2, 4, ..) elements are greater than their adjacent odd elements, we don’t need to worry about odd positioned element. Following are simple steps.
1) Traverse all even positioned elements of input array, and do following.
….a) If current element is smaller than previous odd element, swap previous and current.
….b) If current element is smaller than next odd element, swap next and current.


void sortInWave(int arr[], int n) 
{ 
    // Traverse all even elements 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i+=2) 
    { 
        // If current even element is smaller than previous 
        if (i>0 && arr[i-1] > arr[i] ) 
            swap(&arr[i], &arr[i-1]); 
  
        // If current even element is smaller than next 
        if (i<n-1 && arr[i] < arr[i+1] ) 
            swap(&arr[i], &arr[i + 1]); 
    } 
}
